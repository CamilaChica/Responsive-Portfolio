              I am Colombian, I have always lived in Medellín until March 2nd of 2019 when I came to live in Miami. I'm only child, so you can imagine what this has meant for my parents.
            </p>
            <p class="spaceParagraph">
              Fortunately, I have always stood out for being a very independent person, who makes his own decisions and is not afraid of change.
              To show this, I tell you that in 2014 I led a research group with the Institute of Political Studies of the University of Antioquia that had as a product a book that was published in 2019, after that I graduated in administration, I did a global marketing diplomated and I was studying English for 2 years.
            </p>
            <p class="spaceParagraph">
              I have worked in the sales area in different companies, the last one I worked in is a Peruvian company based in the United States that is dedicated to buying and selling spare parts of aircraft, I have traveled a lot with this work to run different meetings until before to come to Miami.
            </p>
            <p>
              I came to Miami with the purpose of improving my English and learning programming and I found the possibility of doing a Bootcamp at the University of Miami. And although it is difficult to pause after earning good money.
              It is necessary now to dedicate myself to this for full time to fulfill my dream. Nobody said it would be easy.
            </p>
            <p>
              So to summarize, apart from being very independent, I also consider myself a multifaceted person, who adapts easily to change and who is always moving to achieve my goals.
